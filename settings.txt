To edit the images, simply type the relative final path in place of the one listed.
I suggest putting them into the "res" folder, and then updating the file name.
The colors are hexadecimal, to update them simply google "color picker" and copy the number listed.
Be careful that you don't accidentally copy a hashtag (e.g. pasting #ff00ff instead of ff00ff)
