# SquashHunter
Squash Hunter is a simple game. You, the protaginist, must jump over campfires in order to collect the squash that you covet.
## Instuctions:
Press Space to jump.

Run SquashHunter.exe to play, or if you are not on windows run SquashHunter.jar. 

To edit the settings, open settings and change the values listed. Make sure you don't accidentally delete any lines.
I suggest moving all new images into the res folder, and only changing the filename. Colors are hexadecimal numbers,
you can choose new ones from any online color picker. 

If you are interested in the code, most of it is contained in the src folder, in the package com.runner
